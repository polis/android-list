# DaftMobile

## Android: List Tap!

#### Main Goal

Create a simple (single `Activity`) Android Kotlin list app. The app screen is presented below:

> You can see all the functionality in [this video](https://daftmobile-static.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/recruitment/recruitment-internship.mp4).

#### Features

- START button at the bottom
- The app contains a single `Activity`
- All collection elements have two properties: color and number
- Each **red** element's displayed value is multiplied by 3
- Each **blue** element has it's exact value displayed
- There are line separators between elements
- There is no separator below the last element
- Tapping an element adds the model value of the element before it in the collection (modulo number of elements in the collection)
- Pressing **START**:
  - starts a timer which ticks once every second
  - changes the button to a **STOP** button
- Each timer tick runs the following logic:

```
if numberOfElements < 5 then
  appendRandomElement
else
  50% chance -> increment random element
  30% chance -> reset random element counter
  10% chance -> delete random element
  10% chance -> add the model value of the element before it in the collection (modulo number of elements in the collection)
endif
```

#### Hints

- Code functionality is as important as its architecture
- Use `Jetpack Compose` or `RecyclerView` with classic Android layouts
- Consider using `ItemDecoration` for separators (only for `RecyclerView`)
- Use any external libraries that you want
- Do not change gradle configuration script except for the `dependencies` block (for adding libraries or removing unused)
- Do not copy code from the internet without mentioning the author

#### Delivery

Deliver your solution via this repository. Push your commits to the `main` branch.

#### The following elements will be reviewed:

- Implementing all listed features
